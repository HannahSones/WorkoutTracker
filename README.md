## About the project
This application required me to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema for the database creation/management and Express for handling routes. When a user logs a workout, it is saved in a Mongo database and then called to display the last workout on the homepage and a range of stats in graphs based on workouts saved in the database.   
Note: the front-end code was provided for this assignment.

The user is able to to view, create and track daily workouts and log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they can should track distance travelled.


### Built using
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
